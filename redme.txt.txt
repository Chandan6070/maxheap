Example : Enter the size of heap:
		9
	Enter the heap character:
	computer
	Array after max heapification is:

        u       t       p       r       o       m       e
	Enter the new character to be inserted into the heap:
	science
	Array after inserting new character in the heap is:
â– 
        u     t     r      o       p       m       e       c

Chandan Kumar - Came up with the idea of max heap and heap sort
		and coded the programe 

Bhagwat Goutam - Helped in debugging the errors in the
		 code and also given the idea of heap. 

Gunal Binani - Also helped in debugging and checked the 
	       input and output of the program by using 
	       testcases.

Challenges faced: 
		were mainly how to deal with insertion character 
since we were knowing only how to deal with numbers in the heap as
well as in binary tree. And also insertion of new character into heap. 

How we overcame those challenges:
				 going through n number of times
with the code, finally we analayized that we wear missing 1 for loop.
and also took the help of youtube videos.
